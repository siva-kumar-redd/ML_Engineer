Lists allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.

```python
marks = [78, 92, 45, 88]
```

---

## 🔹 Accessing Elements

### Positive Indexing

```python
print(marks[0])
```

Adds an element to the end of a list.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]

numbers.append(40)

print(numbers)
```

Output:

```text
[10, 20, 30, 40]
```

---

### insert()

Adds an element at a specific position.

```python
cities = ["Guntur", "Bangalore"]

cities.insert(1, "Hyderabad")

print(cities)
```

---

### remove()

Removes a specific value.

```python
data = [100, 200, 300, 400]

data.remove(300)

print(data)
```

---

### pop()

Removes an element by index.

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30]

nums.pop()

print(nums)
```

Output:

```text
[10, 20]
```

---

# 🔄 Traversing Lists

Traversing means visiting every element one by one.

```python
nums = [5, 10, 15, 20]

for num in nums:
    print(num)
```

Output:

```text
5
10
15
20
```

---

# 📊 List Analytics

## Sum of Elements

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]

total = 0

for num in nums:
    total += num

print(total)
```

Output:

```text
100
```

---

## Count Elements Greater Than a Value

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

count = 0

for num in nums:
    if num > 25:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

Output:

```text
3
```

---

## Search in a List

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]

if 25 in nums:
    print("Found")
else:
    print("Not Found")
```

Output:

```text
Not Found

---

# 📚 What I Learned Today

## 🔹 Dictionary Basics

A dictionary stores data in:

```text
Key : Value
```

Example:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Siva",
    "age": 21,
    "marks": 92
}
```

---

## 🔹 Accessing Values

```python
student = {
    "name": "Siva",
    "age": 21
}

print(student["name"])
```

Output:

```text
Siva
```

---

## 🔹 Adding New Data

```python
student = {
    "name": "Siva"
}

student["age"] = 21

print(student)
```

Output:

```python
{
    "name": "Siva",
    "age": 21
}
```

---

## 🔹 Updating Existing Data

```python
student = {
    "marks": 92
}

student["marks"] = 97

print(student)
```

Output:

```python
{
    "marks": 97
}
```

---

## 🔹 Removing Data

```python
student = {
    "name": "Siva",
    "age": 21
}

del student["age"]

print(student)
```

Output:

```python
{
    "name": "Siva"
}
```

---

# 🔄 Looping Through Dictionaries

## Printing Keys

```python
for key in student:
    print(key)
```

---

## Printing Values

```python
for key in student:
    print(student[key])
```

---

## Printing Key-Value Pairs

```python
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, value)
```

Output:

```text
name Siva
age 21
marks 92
```

---

# 💻 Programs Implemented

---

## Customer Record

```python
customer = {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Siva Kumar",
    "city": "Guntur",
    "age": 21
}
```

}
```

Most real-world API responses are dictionary-like JSON objects.

---

# 🧠 Debugging & Interview Concepts

## KeyError Example

```python
student = {
    "name": "Siva"
}

print(student["age"])
```

Output:

```text
KeyError: 'age'
```

Reason:
The key `"age"` does not exist.

---

## Logical Error Example

```python
student = {
    "marks": 92
}

student["marks"] = student["marks"] - 100
```

Output:

```text
-8
```

Python executes successfully, but the business logic is incorrect.
